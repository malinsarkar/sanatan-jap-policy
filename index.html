    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Advertising</h2>
    <p>This app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Specifically, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> Google's advertising platform may collect device identifiers (like Android Advertising ID), cookies, and usage data to provide personalized ads. For more information, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Since your data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings.</p>
